# Postmortem

![debugging](debugging.jpeg)

## Debugging Process
1 : Checked running processes using ps aux. Two apache2 processes - root and www-data - were properly running.

2 : Looked in the sites-available folder of the `/etc/apache2/ directory`. Determined that the web server was serving content located in /var/www/html/.

3 : In one terminal, ran strace on the PID of the root Apache process. In another, curled the server. Expected great things... only to be disappointed. strace gave no useful information.

4 : Repeated step 3, except on the PID of the www-data process. Kept expectations lower this time... but was rewarded! strace revelead an -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory) error occurring upon an attempt to access the file `/var/www/html/wp-includes/class-wp-locale.phpp`.

5 : Looked through files in the /var/www/html/ directory one-by-one, using Vim pattern matching to try and locate the erroneous .phpp file extension. Located it in the wp-settings.php file. (Line 137, require_once( ABSPATH . WPINC .` '/class-wp-locale.php' `);).

6 : Removed the trailing p from the line.

7 : Tested another curl on the server. 200 A-ok!

8 : Wrote a Puppet manifest to automate fixing of the error.

## Prevention
This outage was not a web server error, but an application error. To prevent such outages moving forward, please keep the following in mind.

Test the application before deploying. This error would have arisen and could have been addressed earlier had the app been tested.

Note that in response to this error, I wrote a Puppet manifest 0-strace_is_your_friend.pp to automate fixing of any such identitical errors should they occur in the future. The manifest replaces any phpp extensions in the file /var/www/html/wp-settings.php with php.

But of course, it will never occur again, because weâ€™re programmers, and we never make errors!
